# Custom-Calculation-Tool with angular JS

This project aims at creating a tool which will allow users to compare energy usage and annual costs between different types of light bulbs. We come across different calculation tools on the web all the time. Here, we will be calculating the energy costs between various types of light bulbs.

The goal here is to create a calculation tool that will help people compare the energy usage and annual costs to operate each type of bulb. While these calculations will not be as accurate as the full scientific equation for converting lumens to wattage, these values will work for everyday consumers looking to compare the efficacy between light bulbs.

Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Angular JS
